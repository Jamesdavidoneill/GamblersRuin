##  Gamblers Ruin
The Gamblers Ruin problem is simulated as follows:

Two gamblers start with a collection of coins each.
Gambler 1 starts with n1 coins.
Gambler 2 starts with n2 coins.

The two gamblers decide to play a game.
Taking a coin from either gambler, the coin is flipped, giving either heads or tails. If the coin reads heads, the gambler keeps the coin, 
if not, he gives the coin to his opponent.

This is repeated until one of the gamblers has lost all his coins.
(What a terrible game, right?)
